# LAB 03 - Node.js + GitHub Flow

## Current status check

- Git repository exists and is connected.
- Branch format is correct: `feature/Apinaja/initial-setup`.
- Node project initialized with `package.json`.
- Entry file aligned to lab style: `app.js`.

## Project structure (recommended)

```text
Lab03_Nodejs/
	app.js
	package.json
	README.md
	.gitignore
```

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Server URL: `http://localhost:3000`

## Step-by-step for the lab

1. Keep `main` branch clean and updated.
2. For each task, create a new branch:
	 - `feature/<your-name>/read-file`
	 - `feature/<your-name>/write-file`
	 - `feature/<your-name>/http-server`
	 - `feature/<your-name>/http-request`
	 - `feature/<your-name>/module`
	 - `feature/<your-name>/promises`
	 - `feature/<your-name>/async-await`
3. Implement one task in that branch.
4. Run code locally and verify output.
5. Commit and push branch.
6. Create pull request on GitHub.
7. Merge PR to `main`.
8. Pull latest `main` locally.
9. Repeat for next task.

## Collaboration section

1. Add your partner as collaborator.
2. Clone partner repository.
3. Create a new feature branch.
4. Make a small change and push.
